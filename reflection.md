- Tell me about your class! What does it represent?

My class is called Character and represents a character in a video game. The character's attributes include the character's size, which is an ArrayList of items, and 2 integers xPosition and yPosition, representing the character's location. All of these attributes can be altered through the functions in the Contract. All of the functions match that of a character in a video game, moving around, gathering inventory and interacting with their environment. 

- What additional methods (if any) did you implement alongside those listed in the interface?

I didn't implement any additional methods!

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I kept things simple and tried to minimize the number of attributes for the Character class as well as the complexity of each implemented function. It was a little challenging because some of the methods in the interface had a different call signature than I expected - for example, it was specified in the Contract that fly(x,y) returned a boolean, so I had to get a bit creative. I'd recommend to just go function by function and keep it simple!
